        <h2>10 Things I Hate About You (1999)</h2>
        <img src = "images/10_things.jpg" width = 300 alt = "10 Things I Hate About You Film Poster">
        <p>Director: Gil Junger</p>
        <p>Rated: PG-13</p>
        <p>Summary: On the first day at his new school, Cameron instantly falls for Bianca, the gorgeous girl of his dreams. The only problem is the Bianca is forbidden to date until her ill-tempered, completely un-dateable older sister Kat goes out, too. In an attempt to solve his problem, Cameron singles out the only guy who could possibly be a match for Kat: a mysterious bad boy with a nasty reputation of his own.</p>
        <p>My Review: 5/5</p>
        <p>My Thoughts: Although many may think that this film is "predictable", that is just what makes it better. The film starts off strong with a classic banger, "Bad Reputation" by Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and that alone set the pace of the film. It is a classic romantic comedy featuring a golden retriver boy who everyone wishes was theirs including a bad boy that viewers falls in love with. Yet, I still enjoy it everytime I watch it.</p>
