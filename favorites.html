                        <p>My Thoughts: The Florida Project was a film that I had to watch in one of my film classes but I loved every second of it. The colors are so beautiful and the cinematography was excellent. I love watching a film that is in an innocent child's perspective unaware of the adult lives. Don't get me started with the ending scene.</p>

                        <p>My Thoughts: WALL-E is a film for both children and adults. I remember watching it when I was in elementary school but wasn't able to understand the meaning of the film until I got older. I appreciate this film so much because it is a preview of what will happen in the future if us, as humans, keep going down this hole. It is heartwarming and adorable.</p>
