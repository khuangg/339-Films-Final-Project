        <p>Hi! My name is Kristen Huang. I've always had a passion for editing and filming videos since I was in elementary school. I remember working the huge camera in fifth grade as well as hosting my own segment on our school news. During my free time, I film videos of my friends and edit them together. My favorite part is when all of my friends sit together and watch the new video together as laughter and smiles fill the room. However, since coming to college, I haven't had the opportunity or free time to film videos as often as I did back then. Every year I still create a One Second a Day video that I upload on YouTube at the end of every year. Even though I'm not able to create as many content anymore, I absolutely love watching and rating films. I even have an application called "Letterboxd" where I can rate, review, and explore films. My friends and I have a competition every year on who can watch the most films. The page about my favorite films of all time showcases some of my favorite films that I would recommend to my friends if they ever ask. The second page about my favorite romantic comedies is full of my guilty pleasure films. Since my favorite type of films are romantic comedies... I know, not the best genre out there, but I had to dedicate a whole page for them. I love romantic comedy because I love seeing the chemistry of the main characters build on the screen. Even though you can probably guess the outcome for almost all of them, that isn't what matters to me. Seeing the main characters realizing they have feelings for each other is what I live for.</p>
