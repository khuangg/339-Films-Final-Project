                        <p>My Review: 5/5</p>
                        <p>My Thoughts: Although many may think that this film is "predictable", that is just what makes it better. The film starts off strong with a classic banger, "Bad Reputation" by Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and that alone set the pace of the film. It is a classic romantic comedy featuring a golden retriver boy who everyone wishes was theirs including a bad boy that viewers falls in love with. Yet, I still enjoy it everytime I watch it.</p>
